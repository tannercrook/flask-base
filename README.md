# flask-base
A Flask project with a Twitter Bootstrap 4 admin template. If this is your first time using Flask, it is a great way to get started! The repo also is a great starting point for Flask projects.

## Setting up
To set up, first clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/tannercrook/flask-base.git`
Then you need to create a python virtual environment `python3 -m venv venv`
Source the virtual python environment `source venv/bin/activate`

Now we are ready to test, so set the run file `export FLASK_APP=app.py` and then run using `flask run`.
